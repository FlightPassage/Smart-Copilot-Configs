# Smart Copilot | Public

How is this formated?
Since each SmartCopilot Profile is called smartcopilot.cfg, the files have been put into the folders named first based off the developer name and then inside that off the ICAO of the airplane it is designed for.

## Who Made These Files?
These files were made by myself (FlightPassage). Unless stated below:  
DA-42 HeliPilot7 (Chris Stewart)  
B206 Joint Effort HeliPilot7 and Myself
